A secure SPA Shopping list application that lets the user add a recipe to the dashboard, edit it or delete it. The application has the unique feature of letting the user add the ingredients from a particular recipe to your shopping list.

Goals of the Project:
- Integrate Front end and Back end and hence develop a proper MEAN stack application
- Implement an application that helps with dealing real life scenarios
- Implement Security features like using JWT, Auth guards, etc
- Validation of all user input forms
- Fetch data from Back end using API

Tech Stack used:
User <-> Angular: Client asking for Data/ Display data to client
Angular<-> Node.js: Angular making request for Data/ Get the requested Data
Node.js<->ExpressJs: Parse Request/Return Request
ExpressJs<->MongoDB: Ask for data in a way that MongoDB understands / Return data

Core concepts implemented:
-Custom pipes and Directives
-Services for major features
